# EaglerCraft X 1.8.8 u50 for Web Browser

## EaglerCraft is a web-based version of Minecraft made possible by translating its Java code into JavaScript.

I'LL BE UPLOADING NEW VERSIONS EACH UPDATE SO LOOK OUT FOR THEM\!

---

1.8.8 offers a variety of game modes to suit your playstyle. Choose from Survival, where you gather resources and face challenges, Creative, where you have unlimited resources and freedom to build, and Hardcore, a high-stakes mode with permadeath. Whether you prefer playing solo or with friends, EaglerCraft has various options for playing. Join public or private servers online, play with others on your local network, or create your own singleplayer worlds. You can even customize your world's difficulty, game rules, and cheats to personalize your experience. This version of 1.8.8 has both Multiplayer and Singleplayer, so export your worlds from 1.5.2 using EPK or Vanilla formats\!

## How to launch game in browser:

1\. Download the HTML file.

2\. Open the file in your browser using CTRL \+ O.

3\. Let the file load. (You may need to press a key to enable sound, which is required.)

4\. Play the game and have fun\!

## Servers

Go to [this doc](https://docs.google.com/document/u/1/d/1Dz7OAYckd_oea3qUHkRYtT4eZVZjuQalIUKyZ3ZFaEA/edit) to get a list of Multiplayer Server Addresses. I currently make any updates on the document for any new servers created.

## Letting the game load

When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT FOR 1 TO 5 MINUTES\! It will fix itself. It will also be laggy and unstable at first, but it will smooth out after 5 to 10 minutes. Keep in mind that this is an older version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be available, such as the newer mobs and blocks.

Disclaimer: I do not own EaglerCraft or Minecraft, and I am not associated with these games in any way, this is just a way for people to access EaglerCraft fullscreen on their browser.

Notice: There is an issue where audio will become distorted when opening the game on Chromebook, this affects other tabs such as YouTube, YT Music, Spotify and other tabs that use audio. As of 4/22/2025, there is no way to fix this.
