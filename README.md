<h1>EaglerCraft X 1.8.8 u47 for Web Browser</h1>
<head>
<p>
<b>EaglerCraft is a web-based version of Minecraft made possible by translating its Java code into JavaScript.</b>

I'LL BE UPLOADING NEW VERSIONS EACH UPDATE SO LOOK OUT FOR THEM!

 1.8.8 offers a variety of game modes to suit your playstyle.  Choose from Survival, where you gather resources and face challenges, Creative, where you have unlimited resources and freedom to build, and Hardcore, a high-stakes mode with permadeath.  Whether you prefer playing solo or with friends, EaglerCraft has various options for playing.  Join public or private servers online, play with others on your local network, or create your own singleplayer worlds. You can even customize your world's difficulty, game rules, and cheats to personalize your experience. <b>This version of 1.8.8 has both Multiplayer and Singleplayer, so export your worlds from 1.5.2 using EPK or Vanilla formats!</b>

<h1>Letting the game load</h1>

<p>
When you create a new world, it will be a black screen, or you may have spawned underground. <b>ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS WAIT FOR 1 TO 5 MINUTES!</b> It will fix on its own. It will also be laggy and unstable at first, but it will smooth out after 5 to 10 minutes. <b>Keep in mind that this is an older version of Minecraft and that not everything in the real current Minecraft will be avaliable, such as the newer mobs and blocks.</b>
